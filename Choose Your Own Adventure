//the issue I'm having is: the program doesnt seem to want to run the functions, it instead 
//prints out the base text only. Is there a solution to this? Should i put the functions
//in if else statements? I'm going to try this after I send this email. Also is there a way
//for me to make this more efficent? I feel like this program is kind of unwiedly and gross.
